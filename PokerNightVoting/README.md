Poker Night Voting
==================

This is a port of the WWDC2012 application of the same name

This sample application utilizes the EventKit API to allow a user to
create events at specific times.  Users can suggest times for a poker
night with friends, view times suggested by others, and vote on which
time is the most convenient.
