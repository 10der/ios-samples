watchOS 3 Catalog: Using WatchKit Interface Elements
==================================================
 
Xamarin watchOS 3 Preview
-------------------------

This sample is for use with the Xamarin watchOS 3 preview that was release along with our [iOS 10 support](https://blog.xamarin.com/let-the-ios10-ing-begin/). 

1. Right-click the **WatchApp3** project and select **Set as startup project**
2. The simulator list should change to display 38mm and 42mm watch options. If it doesn't change, restart Xamarin Studio.
3. With a *watch simulator* selected, start debugging.
